Birds were singing and the trees were swaying in the breeze. 
People were out enjoying the beautiful day. 
The sky was a deep blue and the air was crisp and clean.

The flowers were in full bloom and the grass was green and lush. 
I took a deep breath and smiled, happy to be alive.

I sat down on a bench and watched the children playing in the playground. 
They were laughing and having so much fun.

I was filled with a sense of contentment and gratitude. 
The birds were chirping and the sun was warm. 
I felt so peaceful and happy in that moment. 
I opened my eyes
